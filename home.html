					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>My name is Antonio Thornton and I currently live in Bruce, Mississippi. I graduated from Bruce High School with honors and decided to take my talents to Base Camp Coding academy. Some of my hobbies include playing and watching sports and going to the gym in my free time. I have always been fascinated by computers and gaming since I was a child. Playing games with my friends and looking at amazingly designed websites piqued my interest in computers and programming by showing me how they worked and all of the different things they can do.</p>
