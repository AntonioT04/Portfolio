						Using only python, I created a game where you can choose 1 player from any of the 10 provided teams starting 5 to play against your opponent. Once you both have chosen a player the game begins and whoever gets to 21 points first wins.

					<p class = "project_desc">
						For this project we made a website dedicated to who we thought was the G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time) to us and I did mine on LeBron James. This project was made with HTML and CSS. In fact, this was my first time using these languages.
